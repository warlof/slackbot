# Version 0.3.1

Due to a Slack API issue in OAuth mechanism which is used by this extension in order to invite and kick user,
the OAuth credentials has been temporarily disabled waiting an answer from Slack support.

In order to provide you a way to keep using the bot, the old connection method has been restored (using testing token).

You need to update the token using the test token and reload supervisor.

Sincere regrets for this perturbation.

# Version 0.3.0

In order to keep people inform, the release 0.3.0 provides a way to get live changelog.

This new feature will be used in order to describe last change in the plugin and will be a way to warn people
about new release.
