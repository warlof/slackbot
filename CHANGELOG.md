**Warning**
> If you already had a working bot prior to this date, the update isn't mandatory and you have nothing to do.

> If you've setting up a new installation, between November 9th and February 18th, you **MUST** drop the existing 
application and create a new one. As soon as the new application has been created, you have to hit the red rubber Button 
on both `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields into SeAT and fill them with the new credentials. Finally, you can hit the
`update` button which will redirect you to Slack Authentication as a fresh bot install.

# Version 2.0.0 announcement
This new version is compatible with SeAT 2.x. I choose to follow SeAT major version in order to make life easiest for maintainers.

Slack RTM has been replaced by Slack Event API which is easier to set than using a Daemon.

Due to this change, Slackbot is no longer processing **Team Invitation**. Team invitation is a non official endpoint which is only usable with test token, and Slack Event require official OAuth token.

**Warning**
> You have to create new credentials in `Slackbot Settings` (follow the link bellow credentials fields).

> Slackbot namespace has changed for `Warlof\Seat\Slackbot` and Slack credentials are now stored into official `Seat` setting table.

> Supervisor configuration related to Slackbot Daemon is non longer required

Redis is now used in order to reduce call amount through Slack REST API.

# Version 0.7.5
Handle `Team Invitation` exception in logs in order to avoid to barely spam SeAT stats with unrelevant exception.
Introduce a new event kind called "sync" into which those exception are published.

# Version 0.7.4
Add a constraint into `slack:users:update` command which exclude `slackbot` from valid users. It appears that `slackbot` is not considered as a bot by Slack API.
We're waiting for a ticket issue response from Slack Team related to this bug.

# Version 0.7.3
Add a local channels clear which will delete no longer valid channels to the command `slack:channels:update` if there is an issue with the daemon.

# Version 0.7.2
remove MPM channels from private channels list

# Version 0.7.0
fix log issues which was logging event even when they didn't happen.
rename slack command
exclude general channel from member list and add general flag to channels

**Warning**
> This update is an upgrade and need a migration. Run `php artisan migrate` command in order to update schemas.

> This update replace `slack:update:channels` and `slack:update:users` with `slack:channels:update`
and `slack:users:update` respectively.

> Due to latest modification, you need to run `slack:channels:update` command in order to update your `slack_channels`
flags.

You need to update the token using the test token and reload supervisor.

Sincere regrets for this perturbation.
